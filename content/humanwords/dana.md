Emilie is fantastic!  I was nervous to give birth, but she made me feel capable and confident.  She provided a wealth of information that helped me understand what to expect, think through my preferences and limits, and process my fears. Her enthusiastic and positive demeanor allowed me to relax and focus on my body and my baby. And when my birth didn’t go at all as planned, I felt prepared for this possibility and thankful to have her there for advice and to support my decisions.  After the birth, she continually checked in on us, and though I didn’t know what help to ask for, just knowing she cared and wanted to make sure we’re doing well meant so much!
