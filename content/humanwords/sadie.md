Emilie was referred to us for her sibling doula services from a local midwife and I couldn't have been happier with her support! I didn't even know sibling doulas were a thing! We had a 19 month old at the time of our homebirth and with no family support in the area we needed someone to take care of our toddler during the labor and delivery. Emilie came over a few weeks before the birth to meet our toddler and us, and learn about her routine, the house layout, etc. I called her when I went into labor and she showed up with a gift bag of activities and a stuffed animal for our daughter (such a sweet touch!) She had a very calm and kind presence and our daughter just loved her! She stayed with us until baby was born and we were settled and comfortable enough to take on our 2 babies under 2! The stuffed animal she got for our toddler is still one of her favorites. She carries it around daily! Thank you Emilie for taking care of our family during such a delicate time!
