milie came into my life when I was very depressed and in need of any kind of support.

Having had to deliver my first baby alone in the US, and away from my husband and family, through a c-section too, I had to go through a lot on my own which drained me physically and emotionally. I was in pain and depressed the whole time, and cried everyday.

Emilie's presence in my life changed everything. I didn't know well what a doula can do to help, but what I know now is Emilie just made it all better for me..

Emilie's warmth, beautiful soul, genuine love and care were more than I could ever ask for.
She's amazing with babies! Her genuine love towards babies is simply mesmerizing and my baby loved her a lot..

Having Emilie there to talk to, hold my baby while I nap, shower, or do anything in the house made a lot of difference..
she was so helpful and would do anything to help..
I started feeling better from her first visit and it kept getting even better until I traveled back to my country.

Emilie was there till the last second helping me pack and making me feel ready to travel alone..

I would forever appreciate her role in my postpartum period, and would want her to be my doula next time I get pregnant.
She's a person whose presence, soul, support can make all the difference any person, especially a mother, can ever need..
