I was Emilie's first birth mama. It was my first time giving birth. She owned the doula title with gentle, yet assertive guidence. Her ability to assess my needs as I was internally processing my labor was astounding. It was a festival birth of 3-4 days of labor and 3 1/2 hrs of pushing and she was there by my side every step. She led my team and advocated for me with grace and diligence, all the while being mindful of my ideals. I am eternally grateful for her unwavoring support throughout. I and my partner would not have been as confident through the journey without her. Even when she wasn't physically holding my hand or hugging me, her energy was a foundation for me, my partner and team. I love her sense of humor, her vibrant style and bright personality. I love her as a person and friend. I would love for her to be my doula again.
