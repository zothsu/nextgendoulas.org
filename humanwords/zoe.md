Emilie was essential to my birth. 

Labor is hard and It was one of the biggest workouts of my life. My husband was my mental support and Emilie was my labor foundation. She kept me hydrated, not waiting for me to ask for water but offering me water with a straw every so often. She tracked down my protein shake and even managed to find me some fruit to snack on when we had forgotten our own snacks. She never left my side without first making sure that someone else was there to take care of me.

There was a lot of time when my husband and I were laboring together and working hard. There wasn’t anything for her to do at those times, but she sat there with us actively waiting for when she was needed. I have never felt that kind of unconditional support in my life.

I ended up having a non-emergent hospital transport after my delivery. I had a third-degree vaginal tear. When it came time to be transported to the hospital Emilie offered to come with me and there was some pushback from others on my care team saying that she didn’t need to come. But Emilie had already asked me what my preference was before transport began and she knew that I wanted her with me. She was polite but firm that she was going to come, if she wasn’t able to come in the transport with me then she was going to meet us at the hospital. I was in no shape to have that conversation and she took the reins advocating for me. 

At the hospital, again she stayed by my side. She was able to text my husband exactly what was going on. I was not in good shape and didn’t feel up to operating a phone. She reminded my hospital care team about my desire for minimal medication and once again was right there with the water keeping me hydrated. Before she left, she asked me how I felt about her leaving and made sure that I was taken care of before she left.

I look forward to having Emilie with us for the birth of our next child!
