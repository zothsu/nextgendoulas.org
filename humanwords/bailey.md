We had the pleasure of working with Emilie as a postpartum doula and she is an absolute angel. So great with our baby, and so supportive to me when I was having a really hard time with lack of sleep and PPD. Emilie is a wonderful listener, and there if you need to talk, or she will also just melt into the background to take care of your newborn and laundry. She would show up and everything would feel better and easier. I recommended her to 2 of my friends who worked with her and loved her as well. If you are considering hiring Emilie - do not hesitate!
