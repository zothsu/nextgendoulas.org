 Emilie was beyond all expectations and became the bedrock of our family immediately. We had our twins very early, after a lengthy NICU stay, they arrived home medically fragile and with challenges. As mom, I also had a dangerous delivery, and came home with limitations myself. Emilie came into our lives with our twins at a time we needed someone we could trust, rely on, nurture us all, and help us get thru a very difficult period. She took such good care of each of us in a way I can't even describe, I'm so deeply thankful for her to this day. She cared for our babies like they were her own, tailoring her approach to their individual needs, she got through difficult nights with such grace and fortitude. I truly wish I could have Emilie in my life in all ways. I cannot recommend Emilie enough to take care of the little people most precious to you.
