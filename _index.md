There is something beautiful about the circle of life. Everything on earth follows the patterns of the seasons and I have always been drawn to the spring. I was born with an innate fascination with mothering, infants, and biology. I knew I wanted to be a mother from the moment I was given my first cabbage patch doll (Leonard Asher). Once I discovered what jobs were, I knew I wanted to work with infants and mothers - first as a pediatrician, then as a midwife, then as a nurse, and for the last 5 years, as a practicing doula. This is my calling and I am so grateful and honored that I’ve been able to do this work.

and I love babies and helping people through difficult situations. Being a doula has fit perfectly into my sense of self. Afterthe birth of my first kiddo..
I gave birth to my first kiddo at the tender age of 19. And I knew then jI wanted to do for the rest of mu life. However bills and three more kidds require that I continue to have a day job. I am fortunate that my employer is aware of my doula work and is very supportive.

Ten years ago I began on my path for a doula certification and twi years ago
No, too soon to talk about any certs. Should wait for five years. Migh scare off potential clients.

In order to make my services available to as many families as possible I accept private insurance though itsabelly and am able to accept ohp though gateway doulsas. If your insurance plan does not cover a doula we can discuss a sliding scale fee.

I gave bith to my first kiddo at the tender age of 19 and knew from that moment on what I wanted to do with the rest of my life. However life waits for no one and bills plus three more kiddos require that I continue with my day job. I am fortunate that my emplpueer is aware of my work as a doula and has been very supportive of that need and understands babies wait for no one.

Ten years ago I began on my path for a doula certification and as of last year I have received my offical certifcation

I should not add that yet

In order to make my services available to as wide a client base as possible I am cantracting with itsabelly (private ins) and gateway (ohp). If your insurace plan does not cover a doula we can discuss a sliding scale fee.

## Services

### Birthing care/ doula

At your birth my most important goal is to keep your birthing hormones level. This involves a close observation of the birthing room for the sake of a smooth birth. READ MORE ON HORMONE INTERRUTION. INSERT LINK HERE. Before attending your vitth we will have ideally five to six vistis before. These visits will allow us to get comfortable with each other and ensure that IU know your needs and can advocate for you.

I can provide you with a space that fits your needs. What is your pain management plan? No medications? All of the medications? Epidural? Lamaze? Spinning Babies? Or are you planning a c-sections? Whatever your choice I will advocate for your wishes when you are unable. 
I am calm in an emergency situation should you help with a premie baby. Is there a special certification I have in premie care?
