        <h2 id="mission-statement">Improving access to trauma-informed doula support throughout pregnancy, labor, and up to one year postpartum.
        </h2>
        <p>Maternal/infant care in the United States is in a state of  crisis. We spend more than other countries on healthcare yet continue to have poorer outcomes. BIPOC and Indigenous women, have over three times higher pregnancy-related mortality rates than White women. Racial disparities persist in preterm births, low birthweight, inadequate prenatal care, and infant mortality. Disparities in outcomes persist for those who are disabled, neurodivergent, LGBTQ, lower income, and those who have been diagnosed with SUD. Numerous studies highlight not only the stigmas held by healthcare providers but also the generational trauma of systemic racism and other traumas, which lead to poorer health outcomes in general. 
        </p>
        <p>Numerous studies also show we heal trauma through connection. Doulas not only educate, advocate, and provide resources to our clients, we validate and empower them. The world has been a little chaotic - bringing a baby into the world right now is a brave choice. The next generation of people coming into the world will probably be the ones who fix it. The first year of life, babies are learning how to be in the world by observing their caregivers - if we can support and soothe the nervous system of the family, we can break the generational trauma that has embedded itself into our DNA. 
        </p>
        <p>Our mission and passion is fostering connection between the baby and their primary caregiver to promote the wellness of the Next Generation ðŸ––

          At the moment, OHP is only covering 8 hours of postpartum doula care - that is not enough. Finally, birth doulas are covered by OHP - but families are often left with few resources while they wait for their 6 week check in. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Private pay clients and donations will go towards providing postpartum services to OHP clients until services are covered by medicaid. Many European countries offer similar services throughout the first year of life.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Tailored postpartum care will be provided for each family during this crucial period, emphasizing respect for individual autonomy and cultural expression.
